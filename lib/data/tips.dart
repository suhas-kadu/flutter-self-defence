It might not dissuade them, but it will definitely make you seem like a difficult target. Also, it will rouse the attention of people around you and get help to you faster. ";

If your attacker is charging towards you, hit their nose with the heel of your palm using all the strength you've got. This will cause immense pain and will temporarily disorient them, allowing you time to call for help or escape.";

If you are attacked at home, run to the kitchen and grab anything like a rolling pin, heavy ladle or a knife. Just remember to be quick!";

Instead of struggling, squat down, lean forward and then bend your elbows all the way towards their arm, till they can no longer hold on. Or simply rotate your wrist to the point where their finger and thumb meet and yank your wrist free. Their grip will be the weakest at that point and a sharp tug will help you escape quickly.";

So yank your arms free of their grapple and hit their head with your elbows as hard as you can. With enough force to the temple, you elbows can potentially cause severe bruising and unconsciousness, crippling your attacker for several minutes.";

Some formulations are powerful enough to cause tearing, irritation and even temporary blindness when sprayed directly into the eyes. This trick works best when your attacker is charging towards you. Keep a can of pepper spray in your purse and in the glove compartment of your car for emergencies.";

When your car breaks down and you cannot figure it out on your own, simply get back inside, leave your headlights on, lock the doors, stay in & phone for help. Do not step out of the car till proper help has arrived. ";
