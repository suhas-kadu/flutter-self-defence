<h3 align="center"><i>"Becuase safety comes first"</i></h3>


## Inspiration

Recently I was scrolling through the Google's solution challenge page. There were various goals for development. The goals were No poverty, Zero hunger, Quality Education, Gender Equality, etc. So I decided to make a project which will Gender equality and Women's Empowerment. Also Women's Day is coming on 8th March, so this was the perfect theme for this project. I have developed a Cross platform, Self Defence App for women. This is built using Flutter and is available on Android and IOS. 

## What it does

This App offers various options as Self defence tips, Self defence moves with videos and steps and a speed dial helpline number.

## How we built it

I have used Dart & Flutter to build this App.

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge was embedding the video and future builder.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud that on this upcoming Women's Day I have developed an application which can help in women's empowerment and will available on Android and IOS.

## What we learned

I have learnt about new widgets in Flutter and also about adding videos in an app.

## What's next for Self Defence App

In Future I'll try to publish this App on Web as well and I'll also try to add authentication system.
